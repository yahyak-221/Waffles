    <p>
      waffles are like not just for breakfast because they are crunchy and soft at the same time and they come from i
      think europe or some place like that and now people eat it everywhere with maple syrup or even chicken which is
      kinda weird but cool
    </p>

    <p>
      and you can put stuff on them and make stacks and they look fun and taste really good i like the sweet ones but i
      think some people like them salty which is also ok i guess
    </p>

    <div class="fun" id="so">
      <span>Fun Spread Fact:</span> did you know waffle is also a verb and also in javascript they use some dots thingy
      called spread and its kinda confusing but also smart
    </div>
